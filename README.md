# Docker Internals

This repo contains a presentation on Docker internals, including cgroups, namespaces, and the Docker ecosystem. This was prepared as a part of a selection task for @kosskgp (Kharagpur Open Source Society).

The presentation is a Reveal.js presentation, and can be viewed in a web browser. It is deployed on GitHub Pages, and can be viewed [here](https://dipamsen.github.io/docker-internals/).

To run the presentation locally, you can clone the repository, and run the following commands:

```bash
cd presentation
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start a local server, and you can view the presentation at `http://localhost:5173`.
