            <p>
              A container is a standalone package of software, which can run in
              any environment. It includes everything needed to run an
              application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and
              dependencies.
            </p>

            <div class="fragment">
              <p>
                Containers allow applications to be
                <strong>isolated</strong> from each other and from the host
                system, ensuring that they do not interfere with each other.

                Containers provide <strong>resource management</strong>
                features, allowing you to limit the amount of CPU, memory, and
                disk space that a container can use.

            <p>
              Docker is a open-source platform that enables developers to build,
              deploy, and manage applications in <strong> containers </strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Docker uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in
              containers.
              This means that each container shares the host OS
              kernel, but runs in its own isolated user space.

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              Containers are an abstraction over Linux kernel features &dash;
              <strong>namespaces</strong> and <strong>cgroups</strong>.

            <div class="fragment">
              <p>
                <strong>Namespaces</strong> provide isolation for processes,
                ensuring that they cannot see or interact with processes in
                other containers or on the host system.
              </p>

            <div class="fragment">

                <strong>Cgroups</strong> provide resource management for
                processes, which can be used to limit and monitor the resources
                that a group of processes can use.

                At the most basic level, a container is just a group of
                processes running on the host system, with their own isolated
                view of the system, and a set of resource limits.

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              Namespaces are a Linux kernel feature that provides an abstraction
              over a global resource. A namespace contains a group of processes
              that (seem to) share an isolated instance of a global resource.
            </p>
            <div class="fragment">
              <p>
                Linux provides different kinds of namespaces for different
                resources. Some of them are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Mount</strong> namespace: provides isolation for the
                  filesystem, allowing each container to have its own view of
                  the filesystem.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>PID</strong> namespace: abstracts the process ID
                  space.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Network</strong> namespace: provides isolation for
                  network resources (devices, IP addresses, routing table,
                  firewall, etc.).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>User</strong> namespace: isolates user and process
                  group IDs.
                </li>
              </ul>

          <h2>Control Groups (cgroups)</h2>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              Control groups (cgroups) are a Linux kernel feature that allows
              you to limit and monitor the resources that a group of processes
              can use.
            </p>
            <div class="fragment">
              <p>
                Cgroups can be used to limit CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network
                bandwidth for a group of processes.
